5.6.2015
Meeting: Maja, Nikola, Peter, Tanja

Repository: GitHub open, potentially another closed one for sensitive data
Nikola to send names for the repositories to Peter
Maja and Tanja to set up accounts
Peter to set up repositories and add us as collaborators 
Peter to send a page with a tutorial 

General: All installations need to be easily recreatable. Peter suggests
Ansible for this  

Documentation: confluence vs. wikimedia - to be decided 

Data and tools:
Nikola to send the list of required installations with priorities,
documentation and dependencies   

Distance learning: EdX, but still to be decided

Sent specification of required installation:

EARLY REQUIREMENTS:

### WebAnno ###
- available at https://code.google.com/p/webanno/

### NoSkE ###
- available at http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske/wiki/Downloads
- will need SSH access to use it

### Wikimedia wiki ###
- decided to go with it as we want to be consistent regarding the use of
- free software

### Worpress ###
- will be used for a linguistic stimuli repository, it could be that Maja
- will need some help with adapting it in a later phase
- our main site will probably be WP as well, no idea what is easier — two
- instances or two sites inside one instance (multisite)


TBD:

### data storage ###
- for now it seems that we will not need a closed git as the potentially
- problematic data will be available at WordPress and it seems not to
- require versioning control
- we opened the ReLDI git at https://github.com/nljubesi/reldi, to be
- discussed if an organization is the way to go (for representation
- purposes, “reldi" is already taken :-( )
- beside git we will need one additional storage option as we sometimes have
- large corpora and lexicons, GBs or even TBs in size, SSH/SCP sounds ok,
- but we are open to better solutions

### API wrappers ###
- I am listing here a part of the current Croatian pipeline (available from
- http://faust.ffzg.hr/nlpws/gui/index.php?menu=box) for tokenization,
- part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization as an example of what kind of a
- mess we want to wrap
- the content of our Makefile is the following:
        python hr_tokenizer.py < ${TAG_FILE} > ${TAG_FILE}.vert
        cat $(TAG_FILE) | ${HUNPOS_DIR}/hunpos-tag ${TRAIN_FILE}.hunpos >
${TAG_FILE}.tag
        awk '{if ($$0!=""){split($$0,a,"\t"); print a[1] "/" a[2]}else{print
"<s/>/Z"}}' ${TAG_FILE} | tr -d " " > ${TAG_FILE}.tagtemp
        ${CSTLEMMA_DIR}/cstlemma -L -i ${TAG_FILE}.tagtemp -f
${TRAIN_FILE}.cstpats -d ${TRAIN_FILE}.cstdict -eU -o ${TAG_FILE}.taglem
        rm ${TAG_FILE}.tagtemp
        sed -r -i 's/<s\/> .*? Z//g' ${TAG_FILE}.taglem
- there are two external dependencies (beside my tokenizer):
        - hunpos https://code.google.com/p/hunpos/downloads/list
        - CST https://github.com/kuhumcst/cstlemma
- it seems to me that a uniform interface, obtained with shell or python
- wrappers, could be the way to go
- people seem to use WebLicht for such tasks as well:
- http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/index.php/Main_Page

### generic tool for building search forms for structured data (lexicons)
### ###
- such search forms can probably be easily built in web.py or Django, but we
- would be interested in a not-a-single-line-of-code approach to building
- simple, but diverse, search forms for structured data (lexicons) encoded
- in JSON, XML or similar

### shell tools ###
- we would need a web-based interface to
        - bash
        - python
        - R (with plotting)

### EdX ###
- to be discussed once we get acquainted with it

MTE DISCUSSION -- bold tagset?
App could just go over to Agp?
Rp and Rr should probably stay in V (as Vmr, Vmp?)
lemmatization? should we keep the V-A connection? if we conflate Agp and
App, then not for sure
Prepositions -- potentially remove the case
Ordinal numerals to adjectives?
Adjectival pronouns to adjectives?
Pronoun categories should be drastically reduced
