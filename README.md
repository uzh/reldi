[Regional Linguistic Data Initiative (ReLDI)](https://reldi.spur.uzh.ch) is a two-year institutional partnership between research units in Switzerland, Serbia and Croatia, funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx) under the [SCOPES programme](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/scopes/Pages/default.aspx) (Scientific co-operation between Eastern Europe and Switzerland).

This is the main development repository for datasets and tools produced inside the project.

Stable versions of datasets and tools are archived in the [Slovene CLARIN repository](https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/discover).
