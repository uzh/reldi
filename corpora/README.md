# Training corpora for Croatian and Serbian

For now the Croatian training corpora are still at its old git repository: http://github.com/ffnlp/sethr/. We expect to migrate that repository to this one, together with publishing the new manually annotated dataset of Croatian, hr500k, described [here](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/summaries/340.html).
